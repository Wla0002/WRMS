# Redneck Stolen Valor

This is a quick piece that I am writing to cover a modern-day case of hypocrisy that I find to be incredibly backwards and in bad faith to the sacrifice of those who gave so much.  

I do not mean for this to be a political hit piece; however, the nature of this topic is inherently political. I do not mean to offend you if you belong to a certain party or not, but the things I will write about draw from my own analysis of the current political spectrum existing in my state and country.  

The state I am referring to, of course, is **West by God Virginia**.

## Defending West Virginia

As stated in other parts of this blog, I have developed into a strict West Virginia defender—one of West Virginia’s strongest soldiers, if you will. The national rhetoric surrounding my home state is what I attribute this to.  

Believe it or not, WV is not the most prosperous, and due to many reasons, it is the target of many jokes, jabs, and misconceptions.  

Of course, the usual:  
- “cousin f---er”  
- black lung  
- illiterate  
- backwoods rhetoric  

...has been consistently a part of the perception.  

Even recently I was watching a YouTube video where a guy who worked with mentally ill people in West Virginia called into a show to talk about his experiences. The host mentioned that the caller was very well spoken, seemed well read, and “didn’t seem to be illiterate,” implying he must be an outlier in WV.  

I know this wasn’t meant to be hurtful (probably), but to me it shows that **West Virginia suffers from an “illiterate until proven literate” situation** when questioned from outside sources.  

This isn’t new. When my father subscribed to *The Wall Street Journal* in the mid-90s, there was an article that highlighted West Virginia and their “regular use of the outhouse.” There was no reason to paint this picture of West Virginia, and he cancelled the subscription then and there.  

The hypocrisy lies in those willing to believe that most if not everyone in WV is illiterate, stupid, outhouse-using—without realizing the ignorance of their own false logic.

## The Forgotten Sacrifice

I don’t plan on covering every instance of this rhetoric, nor would I be able to. One thing I want to cover here is the **sacrifice West Virginians paid in the 1880s–1920s**, the result of that suffering, and how that hardship extends to the present day—mostly unrealized by others in our nation.  

West Virginia has a long history of being **used**:  
- Natural resources extracted  
- Human resources oppressed  
- Wealth expelled elsewhere  

When the coal companies came into the state, the mountaineers who settled here had their own communal justice systems. But the coal companies **usurped the land** through dubious contracts that were legal in the eyes of the federal government, but immoral to the people who lived there.  

The result?  
- Coal companies bought the state.  
- They killed the diverse economy.  
- They relegated West Virginians into **indentured servitude**.  

The companies:  
- Owned the miners’ homes  
- Owned the stores that sold food and equipment  
- Printed their own currency (scrip)  
- Owned the churches (where priests warned against collectivization)  
- Owned the schools (keeping kids just smart enough to work in the mines)  

The miners had **no leverage, no job market, no way out**. If they threatened to unionize, they were beaten by Baldwin-Felts detectives, or evicted from their homes.  

West Virginia became a **dystopian company state**. And at that point, there were only two choices:  
1. Get in the mines.  
2. Fight.

## When Peaceful Revolution Was Impossible

As JFK once said:  
> “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.”  

The miners set up tent cities in the woods during strikes. These were often **shot at by agents**—tents with miners’ families inside.  

This pushed miners to literally take up arms against the coal companies and Baldwin-Felts. They wore **red bandanas** around their necks (origin of the word “redneck”) and fought like hell.  

- Many miners died.  
- The U.S. military was eventually sent in—planes even dropped bombs on miners.  
- When miners realized they were fighting the U.S. Army, they laid down arms, not wanting to fight the military they still respected, even though it sided with their oppressors.  

This was the **largest domestic uprising since the Civil War**.  

This is the sacrifice I’m talking about. The industrial revolution that made the United States the greatest empire in history was **fueled by coal mined by West Virginian indentured servants**.

## From Coal to Opioids

Since then, West Virginia has **never recovered** from its lack of industrial diversity.  

The trickle-down effects:  
- Drug epidemics  
- Disasters  
- Generational poverty  
- Exploitation by the same wealthy class that once owned the mines  

When coal collapsed, the basket exploded.  

Then came the **opioid epidemic**—purposefully created to profit off addiction. West Virginia was hit hardest. This wasn’t an accident; it was proven in court.  

And yet, the wealthy individuals and corporations responsible remain untouchable, **still gaming the system**.

## Political Hypocrisy

Both parties are guilty, but one in particular has enabled this exploitation in its modern form: **the Republican Party**.  

- They passed massive tax cuts for billionaires.  
- Increased federal debt by trillions.  
- Cited the disproven Laffer curve as justification.  
- The richest 400 people in the U.S. are now worth **$6.6 trillion**, $1.2 trillion richer in just the past year.  

Meanwhile:  
- Housing crisis  
- Cost of living crisis  
- West Virginians without clean water  
- Cuts to cancer research, Medicaid, SNAP, education, black lung research, and mental health facilities  

All while voters are distracted by wedge issues:  
- Trans people in sports  
- School vaccination policies  
- Motorcycle standing laws  

In my state, **redneck identity is worn like a badge of honor**, but the people who wear it now support the same ruling class the original rednecks **literally fought against with rifles**.  

That is **redneck stolen valor**.

## My Wish for West Virginia

I wish we, as a state, could cut through the daily bullshit we are fed and remember the resolve of those who risked it all for prosperity.  

I wish we could **hold the powerful accountable** for their actions, which are not in our best interest.  

West Virginia has so much potential. Yet it remains unrealized.
