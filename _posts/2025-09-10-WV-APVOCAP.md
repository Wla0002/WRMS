# West Virginia, A Perpetual Victim of Curses and Perception

**Well Respected Media Source, 26, Morgantown, WV**

I am a native West Virginian dedicated to bringing awareness to the unique societal challenges faced by the great people of my state. In this piece, I speak candidly about our hardships, touching on key issues without delving too deeply into each one. You are encouraged to explore these topics further—whether through independent research or links to my more in-depth posts where applicable.

This is a modern-day folklore piece, a reflection of the lived experiences and perceptions of West Virginians. While not every detail may align perfectly with recorded history, that does not diminish the reality we see before our eyes.

## My Experiences  

As a West Virginian, you may look and sound like the average American, but as soon as someone learns where you're from, stereotypes start to emerge.  

Much of my family is from Pittsburgh, PA. One of my earliest memories, when I was seven years old, took place at my grandmother’s house in Pittsburgh. I was playing with my cousin and his friend, both typical yinzers. His friend asked me where I was from, and when I replied, “West Virginia,” he immediately labeled me with a slur: *“hillbilly cousin f--ker.”*  

At seven years old, I didn’t fully understand the words, but the disdain in his voice made their intent clear.  

On the drive home, I asked my parents what it meant. They didn’t answer. Their silence told me they knew, but they didn’t know how to explain it to a child.  

As I grew older, I became more familiar with this kind of treatment. Media like *Buckwild* highlighted exaggerated, depraved caricatures of West Virginians, broadcasting them to the world and reinforcing misunderstandings. This wasn’t new. Pop culture has long fed into harmful Appalachian stereotypes, from *The Beverly Hillbillies* to *Wrong Turn* and *The Hills Have Eyes* (despite the latter being set in New Mexico, but I digress).  

Even within the state, many in north-central West Virginia—a relatively more prosperous region—try to distance themselves from the hardships of southern West Virginia. I often heard people say:  

> “I’m from northern West Virginia; it’s not like the southern part of the state.”  

as if preemptively shielding themselves from judgment. I believe this was an attempt to soften the label of being from West Virginia, hoping to be treated as a “normal” person rather than a walking stereotype.  

Later in life, I moved to Tucson, Arizona, for about a year, far from the country roads I had come to love and understand. When people learned I was from West Virginia, they would often say:  

- “You don’t look like someone from West Virginia.”  
- “You have more teeth than I imagined.”  

While these comments weren’t necessarily intended to be hurtful, they carried an implicit insult. It was as if they were reassuring me that I wasn’t *one of those West Virginians*—the inbred, uneducated caricatures they had been conditioned to expect.  

I don’t mean to paint all people who misunderstand West Virginia as deliberately cruel. Many simply don’t know what they don’t know. Genuine curiosity can sometimes expose these misunderstandings in a way that isn’t meant to be offensive but still is.  

While talking with friends in Wisconsin, I was asked:  

- “I’m surprised you don’t have an Appalachian accent.”  
- “Do you know anyone who has black lung or died in the mines?”  

These questions weren’t meant to be malicious, but they revealed a sad reality: no one outside the region truly understands the suffering and hardships our people have endured. Instead, they continue to perpetuate harmful stereotypes born from systemic oppression and decades of neglect.

## Historical Context  

> “The sun doesn’t always shine in West Virginia, but the people do.” – John F. Kennedy  

West Virginia’s recorded hardships date back to the 1770s, when American frontiersmen made their way westward. The region was home to seven Indigenous nations: **the Shawnee, Delaware, Wyandot, Mingo, Miami, Ottawa, and Illinois.**  

These tribes formed a formidable union under the leadership of **Chief Cornstalk**, a figure known for both his diplomatic skills and military prowess. As settlers encroached upon the Kanawha and Ohio River valleys, Cornstalk amassed 1,200 warriors to resist them. His name became synonymous with fear and respect among those who opposed him.  

### The Curse of Cornstalk  

One of the most pivotal conflicts occurred in what is now **Point Pleasant, West Virginia**. Though the battle resulted in 140 settler casualties compared to the Indigenous forces' 380 losses, it was still considered a strategic victory for Cornstalk’s forces given their disadvantages in firepower and numbers.  

Eventually, both sides sought peace, and Cornstalk’s reputation as a leader, diplomat, and military strategist grew.  

During the American Revolution, Cornstalk sought peace with the colonists, even training colonial soldiers in tactics. However, he, Red Hawk, and his son Ellinipisco were murdered in cold blood by enraged colonial soldiers.  

As legend has it, Cornstalk’s dying words laid a curse upon the land:  

> “I was the border man’s friend. Many times, I have saved him and his people from harm... You have murdered me by my side, my young son... For this, may the curse of the Great Spirit rest upon this land...”  

Though the notion of a curse may be scientifically implausible, it poetically mirrors the hardships West Virginia has faced throughout its history.

### The Coal Wars and Exploitation  

Before the Civil War, most West Virginians lived in small, tight-knit homesteads, isolated from the rest of the country. Families thrived on hunting, fishing, and farming. Success was measured by survival, not wealth.  

But war and industry disrupted this way of life.  

After the Civil War, out-of-state companies exploited West Virginians by coercing illiterate farmers into signing away their land for coal. Miners were paid in company scrip, forced into debt, and terrorized by private security forces like **Baldwin-Felts** and the **Pinkertons**.  

The people fought back—culminating in uprisings such as the **Battle of Blair Mountain** and the **Paint Creek & Cabin Creek Strikes**, the largest armed insurrections in U.S. history outside of the Civil War.

### From Blue State to Exploited State  

For decades, West Virginia was a stronghold for the Democratic Party due to its union roots. But as education declined and labor history was erased, the people were misled into focusing on trivial political issues.  

In recent decades, pharmaceutical giants like **Purdue Pharma**, **Cardinal Health**, **AmerisourceBergen**, and **McKesson** targeted West Virginia, flooding it with opioids. Despite devastating consequences, settlements awarded the state a fraction of what it deserved.  

The very attorney general who oversaw this settlement is now the **Governor of West Virginia**, riding national narratives while ignoring systemic issues.

## Requiem for the Big Yeast  

ESPN’s *30 for 30: Requiem for the Big East* scapegoated West Virginia, suggesting its inclusion led to the downfall of the conference. They played *Dueling Banjos* and mocked Mountaineers as backward hillbillies.  

This narrative was absurd. WVU carried the Big East with Sweet 16, Elite 8, and Final Four appearances in basketball, plus three BCS bowls in football. The real culprit? **ESPN-driven conference realignment** motivated by TV money.  

Yet West Virginia was cast as the villain—another case of prejudice shaping perception.

## A Tradition of Exclusion  

Sports history further highlights West Virginia’s exclusion:  

- **1930s SoCon Split:** WVU opposed postseason bowls in favor of academics. Maryland resented this and later blocked WVU’s ACC entry.  
- **2010 ACC Expansion:** Maryland again cited poor academics and fan reputation to deny WVU.  

One infamous (and false) story reinforced this narrative—that a WVU fan defecated in the Georgia Tech band section during the 2006 Gator Bowl. The article was a hoax authored by *George P. Burdell*, a known Georgia Tech prank pseudonym.  

Though Sports Illustrated later retracted it, the damage was done.

Ultimately, WVU landed in the **Big 12**, saddled with high travel costs and national neglect.

## Closing Thoughts  

Sports are a small reflection of the larger socioeconomic injustices West Virginians face. Unlike other oppressed groups, West Virginians never had a civil rights movement or a history month to spotlight their struggles.  

Yet, through all the hardship, West Virginians remain some of the **most helpful, hospitable, and resilient people** in America.  

> Though the sun may not always shine in West Virginia, its people continue to shine through the darkness.
